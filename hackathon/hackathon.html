                        <h4>Needs and challenges</h3>
                            <p>Government agencies need to raise awareness and show the value of their open data. The challenge
                                for contestants is to make use of open data from government agencies (possibly combined with
                                other data sources) in new solutions that create increased value in the society. A solution
                                can comprise of a working technical solution, a prototype or a concept. The challenge for
                                the government agencies is to spread and practically show the value with their open data.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h4>Data sources</h3>

                                    a description as to what it contains and its eventual terms of use. Other data sources
                                    may be used but qualification to the competition requires that data from at least one
                                    of the listed data sources is included. The process of making new data accessible is
                                    continuous, thus new data may be appended up to the start of the competition. Any new
                                    data will be updated on the web site.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

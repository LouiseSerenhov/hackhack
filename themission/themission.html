                            <p>
                                Our mission is to build a community around the common goal of leveraging open data to enable creative solutions to make an
                                impact on our society. As an outcome it will further stimulate and support government agencies
                                in their ongoing work aimed at making more data available.
                                <br> <br> In 2018, as part of the process of increasing the digitalization of the public
                                sector, the government put focus in open data and data-driven innovation. Public sector,
                                academic sector, enterprizw and creative organizations from civil society need to interact
                                and collaborate. Through open and data-driven innovation, more and more people can contribute
                                to tomorrow's digital welfare society and together create social benefits. Increased re-use
                                of open data contributes to increased growth, participation and efficiency. The government
                                further argues that where there is social benefit, the public should be included as an active
                                partner. Access to authority data, provided that these data have been made available as open
                                data, can lead to a variety of benefits for both society and the economy. This includes giving
                                citizens, businesses and civil society the opportunity for increased and more democratic
                                involvement in the authorities' activities, for example in policy design and implementation,
                                but also in transparency in government decisions. Government advocates the conscious use
                                of open source solutions, standards and test beds.
                                <br> <br> One of the government's objectives is a more open management that supports innovation
                                and participation. Authorities should actively seek to enable effective re-use of public
                                information to facilitate the emergence of an information market and to help strengthen people's
                                self-government and exercise of human rights. If public data is published for reuse, this
                                may be used to e.g. construct new e-services. One way to promote re-use of data is to arrange
                                competitions in the form of so-called hackathons.
